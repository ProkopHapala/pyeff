# pyeff eff1
- clean pyeff_calculator.py (may create a energy_force function for initialize and calculation or combine them) 
- very important: design a fix nucleus (read nrlmol optimized nucleus and then only optimize classical electron positions?) 
		  design a cfg2clusterfrmorb function for conversion of the eff structure input to nrlmol structure input 	
- decrease io part in pyeff_optimizer.py (dont write_input(x) directly caculate from a x vector energy and forces) 
- check rights of the structs/*cfg files and change them accordingly 
# pyeff eff2,eff3,eff+ecp 
- implement the other eff version and check atoms (N,O,F) like it is shown on the eff-code homepage

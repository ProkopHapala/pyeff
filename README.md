## Description 

PyEFF is a implementation of the electron force field (currently in the EFF1 formulation). In contrast to the orginal implementation the main focus of this implementation is the optimimization of nuclei and electron positions ("thermostatics"). 
The code is written in a way to be readable for anyone and not optimized for large scale production runs.

## Installation 

Pyeff is written in python and depends on the python - packages: 

- numpy 
- scipy 
- ase 

and for debuging purpose on 

- sympy 

as well as 

- matplotlib 

for plotting purpose.

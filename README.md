## Description 

PyEFF is a implementation of the electron force field. In contrast to the orginal implementation 
the main focus of this implementation is the optimimization of nuclei and electron positions ("thermostatics"). 
The code is written in a way to be readable for anyone and not optimized for large scale production runs. 

##### Theoretical background
 - some EFF papers

## Installation 

Pyeff is written in python and depends on the python - packages: 

- numpy 
- scipy 
- ase 

and for debuging purpose on 

- sympy.

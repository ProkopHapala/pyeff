This example shows how to calculate ionziation potentials with pyeff. 

(1) You need to run the H2 example 
(2) Run this example: cmd: bash job.sh  
(3) grep the final energy with, e.g grep 'Etot' pyeff.log 
    and compare your results with: python ip.py 

Note: We use the Delta-SCF method here: 

IP = E(N) - E(N-1), 

therefore we have to relax the orginal system (E(N), here H2) 
and then use this geometry remove one electron, fix the nucleus positions 
(fix_nuc = 'True') and then run the pyeff calculation for the E(N-1) 
geometry. 

In this example we run 1st a optimization run and then a single point calculation. 
What do you observe when you are comparing the results? 

Note: With the clean.sh skript you can "clean" your results (cmd: bash clean.sh).

This example shows how to use pyeff for optimization of Fermi-Orbital-Descriptors. 

(1) Convert SYMBOL and FRMORB to pyeff input (nrlmol.cfg file)
(2) Run a pyeff optimization of the electrons (fixed nucleus, pyeff option: fix_nuc = 'True') 
(3) Write the pyeff optimized electron positions as new FRMORB file (FRMORB.pyeff) 

Run in your bash following command: 

bash job.sh 

and see what happens.

You can watch the calculated trajectory (xyz-file format, called pyeff_movie.xyz) 
with a crystall structure viewer you prefer (e.g ase-gui, xcrysden, jmol, etc.).
